# **Definition of Event**

# :

# An event is something that occurs or happens.

# Event Extent : An Event extent is a sentence within which a taggable Event is described.

# Event Trigger : trigger is a word that most clearly expresses the occurrence of an Event.

1.
# **Tagging :**

# We will tag the states that result from taggable Events. These will be annotated in exactly the same manner as the corresponding action Events.

# As sentential predicate:

# Meals are

# **served.**

# Her father is

# **retired.**

# As a present-participle in the nominal premodifier position:

# The

# **running**

# team

# The

# **helping**

# man

  1.
# **Events Extent:**

# The entire sentence in which events are described.

#
 My grandma

# **realized**

# that the donkey

# **needed**

# medical help.

# **Note:**

# In some examples,

# underlining

# will be used to indicate words which may mistakenly be identified as the trigger of the Event and

# **bold face**

# will be used to indicate the actual trigger of the Event mention.

  1.
# **Event Triggers:**

    1.
# Trigger is a word that most clearly expresses its occurrence. Most of the time main verbs present in the sentence are considered as triggers.

    1.
# Event triggers could be parts of speech such as verbs, nouns, adjectives. Adverbs and prepositions are not annotated as events.
    2.
# No restriction on the type of events that are tagged.

# The mice

# **found**

# three little bells.

# He

# **rewarded**

# hari handsomely

    1.
# Sometimes , the main verb will be in the form of an adjective or a past-participle.

# Wolf was

# **spotted**

# in the neighborhood.

# Chief Kaliya was

# **confused**

# .

    1.
# Other times, the Event reference is used in a modifier position, either in the form of a participle or an adjective. In such cases, the modifier should be annotated as the trigger for the Event:

# It was a

# **forgotten**

# village.

# The

# **rioting**

# approached the capitol.

    1.
# Events are also triggered by nouns or pronouns:

# The

# **accident**

# injured 15 and killed

#

# 3.

# Yesterday&#39;s

# **attack**

# was entirely unexpected.

# Note: Sometimes it will be necessary to annotate noun triggers whose type and subtype are indicated by mentions outside the scope:

# The two were

# **married**

# on July 20.

# **It**

# was a joyous

# **Event**

# .

# **Event Normalizations and Pronormalization:**

  1.
# **Annotation of Complex Examples:**

    1.
# There is an Event that is mentioned by multiple words within the same scope, in a way that makes it difficult to identify a single word as the trigger. A good example of this is:

# The leaders

# **held**

# a

# **meeting**

# in Beijing.

    1.
# There are a number of distinct Events mentioned within the same scope (either all taggable Events or a mix of taggable and non-taggable Events). A good example of this is:

# The

# **attack**

#

# **injured**

# 15 and

# **killed**

# 3.

    1.
# **Multiple possible trigger**

# :

      1.
# **Rules for differentiate between cases whether two triggers referring to the same Event or different Events**

# .

1.
# If person doing the one &#39;Event&#39; is the same as the person doing the other , else they are two different Events.
2.
# If one event is a subpart of there then they are same event, else they are two different Events.

1.
# If one Event is telling another Event&#39;s internal structure, else they are two different Events.


2.
# In the situation of confusion always consider there are two different Events present.

# Kennedy was

# **shot dead**

# by Oswald

# .

# The hurricane

# left

# 20

# **dead**

# .

#

# She speaks

# **lies**

# .

#

The first example will be annotated as two separate Events because the &#39;secondary trigger&#39; actually expresses the occurrence of a separate (and taggable) Event, whereas the second example will be annotated as a single Event triggers by the word dead because left and dead are being used together to express the same Event. This is a difficult decision and care should be taken in annotating examples such as these.

#

  1.
# **Stand-Alone Noun Rule:**

# When there are more than two triggers possible, a noun is selected , if that noun is referring to the Event.

# Hamas

# launched

# an

# **attack**

# .

# The leaders

# held

# their

# **meeting**

# in Boston.

# He

# carried out

# the

# **assassination**

# .

# The presidents

# met

# for a working

# **lunch**

# of around 75 minutes.

# The company was

# ordered

# to

# pay

# a

# **fine**

# of $300,000.

# Brentwood Academy

# responded

# with a

# **lawsuit**

# .

  1.
# **Stand-Alone Adjective Rule:**

# Whenever an adjective and a verb are used together, the adjective is selected, if that adjective is referring to the Event.

1.
# **Four dimensions for tagging**

# :

# **Polarity, Tense, Genericity and Modality**

  1.
# **Polarity:**

# Events must have a positive polarity, negative polarity will be ignored.

# Ram

# **gave**

# the test and didn&#39;t

# fail

# **.**

# Ganesha had not

# moved

# from his spot

# Bheema did not even

# look up

  1.
# **Tense:**

# Events must be in the past or present tense. Events in the future tense are not tagged

# He

# **traveled**

# to Delhi in last september.

# They will

# meet

# next month.

  1.
# **Genericity:**

# tag only specific events, all generic events are ignored. Specific events : &quot;a singular occurrence at a particular place and time&quot;.

# I

# **ate**

# rice for dinner last night.

# People often

# eat

# rice for dinner.

  1.
# **Modality:**

# Actually occurred are tagged. All other modalities (believed, hypo- thetical, desired, etc.) are not.

# He

# **walked**

# to

# buy

# some cold drinks

# .

# They would not

# trouble

# the Devas again.

# Rumors of

# arrests

# circulated in Vancouver

# If you keep

# grabbing

# a dozen people every day and

# eat

# them up, soon there would be no more people left in the town

1.
# **Rules for stative Event:**

  1.
# If an immediate or clear change of state occurred (it could be beginning, ending or any change or alteration), and this change can be described where event trigger appears,


  2.
# If the cause of the state can be determined, and the resulting state and cause have happened at the same place.
 eg.

# _When he received this appointment ,he was both_

# _ **elated** _

# _and_

# _ **appalled.** _

#


  3.
# Triggers which refer to the mental state has to be acute, such as words &quot;

# _ **amazed** _

# ,&quot; &quot;

# _ **impressed,** _

# &quot; &quot;

# **surprised**

# ,&quot; and &quot;

# _ **stunned** _

# &quot; etc

# .

1.
# Notes:

  1.
# Every main verb should not be considered as an Event Trigger.
